============= Logic =============
[x] update buttons so that checking isn't allowed by first player preflop
[x] automate next hand

    - big job


============= UI =============
1 [ ] Textbox
  [x] dealer button
  [x] highlight the player who has current action
  [x] display player bets
      [x] position player bets
  [ ] display player number / name
      [ ] create overloaded constructor for player class wherein we can give a player a string name
      [ ] position player name
