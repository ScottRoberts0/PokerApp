Start game:
    Server builds it's table UI, deals cards, etc
    Server sends each client their player number and waits for a response.
        When each client gets their player number, they build their blank table UI and await the player data broadcast.
    When server sees all players have gotten their player number and responded, broadcast the general game data.
